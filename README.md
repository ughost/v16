v16 
===

v16 is a small JavaScript tool for building fast, robust and reliable web applications.. or just cleaning some mess around your project.

## Quick start
Choose one of the following options:
1. download .zip file and unpack it into your project.
2. clone the git repo â€” `git clone https://github.com/ughost/v16.git` into your project /js directory.

Installation example
____________________
I know.. there is 3 requests for small files, but if you look a little bit closer to it you can find that this is really fine solution.

	<!DOCTYPE HTML>
	<html lang="en-US">
		<head>
			<meta charset="UTF-8">
			<title>v16 EXAMPLE</title>
			
			<script src="/js/lib/v16.starter.js"></script>
		</head>
		<body>
			<div>
				CONTENT
			</div>
			
			<script src="/js/lib/v16.parts.js"></script>
			<script src="/js/lib/v16.engine.js"></script>
		</body>
	</html>

..at the production environment you can merge v16.parts and v16.engine files, but while development better leave it in separated form.

## Features
### 1. easy bind possibility into your existing structure of project
that allows you to call it on this way (by default): `v16.use(['partA', 'partB']);`
..or this way: `myProject.dispatcher.use(['partA', 'partB']);`

To set it edit last line of: `v16.starter` and `v16.engine` and change it from:

	/* ... */
	})(/*object*/ window /*string*/ /*, "engineName"*/);
	
(which defines default namespace: `window.v16`), to something like that:

	/* ... */
	})(myProject, 'dispatcher');
	
only one reqired thing is that `myProject` should exist before `v16.starter` without mooving it anywhere from head.

### 2. global parameters getter&setter
there is nothing special to comment here, you can easy use to get&set parameters froum you aplication source anytime

	v16.set('param1', 'value of 1');
	v16.set('param2', 'value of 2');
	
	/* */window.console && console.log(v16.get('param1'));

set&get have one more usefull variation of use:

	//set few parameters in one call
	v16.set({
		param1 : 'value of 1',
		param2 : 'value of 2'
	});
	
	//get whole parametrs tree (for debug purposes)
	v16.get();
	
### 3. parts declatarion
Most important elements of each engine are parts - so we need to declare implementation of each one by using `v16.newPart()` in `v16.parts` file, like that:

	v16.newPart('mainSlider', function () {
		/* slider implementation */
	});
	
after that we just need to `use` this part (next chapter) if it needed.

Parts can also use itself automatically after engine initialization. To do that set the third parameter of it declaration to `true`, f.e.:

	v16.newPart('mainMenu', function () {
		/* implementation of element available on each page */
	}, true);
	
### 4. using parts
If you want to use some part declared in `v16.parts.js` you just need to call it from the source of your document like that:

	<div id="mainSlider">
		<ul class="slides"><!-- ... --></ul>
		<ol class="pagination"></ol>
		
		<script> v16.use('mainSlider'); </script>
	</div>
	
..or like that:

	v16.use(['mainSlider', 'footerSlider']);

This feature builds sack of parts and use each of it in order of use `.use()`

Important:
 - 1 call = 1 call, so if you use this part couple times engine call it couple times (it usefull too).
 - parts called by `.use()` after the engine starts (f.e. to bind some AJAX response) will be started immediately.
 - stack can be increased while the engine starts so one part can use another one.
 - if engine found some part which declaration type !== 'function' it will call each of method of this object (?todo: new $part).
 
### 5. gears declaration
This can be usefull when you whant to call some part after redirect whitout any dirty tricks.

Gears got simple structure where name of `gear` is that what you must set in activator to "roll the `gear`" - in this case activator is `location.hash`, look at the definition of `gear`:
	v16.newGear('thankYou', function () {
		window.alert('Thank you for smth! :)');
	});

..this `gear` appears once after it declaration and will be dismount after the "roll". So if you redirect user to f.e.: `http://example.com/#thankYou` it'll "roll" and dismount after it.

You can automatically remount the gear after it's roll by adding 3rd parameter to it declaration:
	v16.newGear('signIn', function () {
		/* show signIn popup.. or smth */
	});

..so each time when you set `location.hash` to "#signIn" you roll that gear.

## TADA!
Simple - huh? :)
